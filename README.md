# A Multi-purpose modern Bootstrap 5 theme

This theme was part of the course I enrolled in on Udemy long ago. It had this as the final project. I really liked the design of it. So, I decided to re-master this using Bootstrap 5 and other updated libraries. This project uses various plugins for sliders, animated counters and carousel.

## Plugins

| Library	  | Purpose 						|
| ----------- | ----------------------- 		|
| Bootstrap 5 | CSS Framework without JQuery |
| BoxiIcons | Alternative to Font-Awesome icons |
| Swiper JS | Creates Slideshow/Carousel |
| PureCounter JS | Animated Counters |
| Glightbox | Lightbox Gallery |
| Isotope Layout | Gallery image classification |
